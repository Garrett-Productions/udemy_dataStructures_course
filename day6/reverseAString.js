// We can treat a string just like an array an access it by index, and run built ins like we can on an array

// first check if its a string
// second, create a var as an empty array thats gonna house all my reversed values
// third, create a variable equal to the string minus 1 
// fourth, loop through that string and decrement i every time 
// fifth, in the code block, .push each char or index to our array var.
// sixth, console log our array var for assurance, and return our array as a string by .join
