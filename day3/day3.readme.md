Number of Operations in an algo goes like this.. If we loop 8 times, then there are 8 number of operations

As inputs increase thwe # of operations increase with it, in linear time
If the input only has 1 value its taking in and only using 1 loop, or 1 operation, then it'd be O(1) operation

Linear Time = the amount of time it takes for a function to finish, based # of operations in input
