Number of Operations in an algo goes like this.. If we loop 8 times, then there are 8 number of operations

As inputs increase thwe # of operations increase with it, in linear time
If the input only has 1 value its taking in and only using 1 loop, or 1 operation, then it'd be O(1) operation

Linear Time = the amount of time it takes for a function to finish, based # of operations in input

Constant Time*** its a flat line, we are grabbing one, like array[0] or array[1], it doesnt matter how many inputs we have we are only finding one

There are 4 rules to Calculate big O of (n) down to just O(n)

Rules
---------------1. WORST CASE ---------------------


-------------2. Remove Constants ------------------
