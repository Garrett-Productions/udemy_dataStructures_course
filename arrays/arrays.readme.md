Sometimes called list, organize items sequentically,
Built ins are: Lookup O(1), push O(1), insert O(n), delete O(n)

Arrays are ment if you need to store data and iterate over it step by step, lookup and access with arrays in constant time, push is also fast but insert and delete are linear time

const strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
// 4*4 = 16 bytes of storage
// we stored it, lets grab it
