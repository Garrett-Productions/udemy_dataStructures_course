We talked about static and dynamic arrays.

We talked aboit big(O) complexity, both space and time and how arrays function within that rule
Built Ins:(static) lookup, push, insety, delete: (dynamic) lookup, append, insert and delete

String questions can be handled like array questions, by split() the split.

Arrays are really good at having sorted data!

When would you want to use an array? When not?

ARRAYS ARE GREAT FOR:
* Fast Lookups ( which index do you want to look up?)
* Fast Push/Pop
* ordered 


Arrays aren't that good for:
* slow inserts and deletes because we have to shift the array whenever its not at the very end of the array
* when using static arrays, fixed size, sometimes you have to declare memory ahead of time, use more modern languages
