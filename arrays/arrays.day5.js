//What about Splice?

// splice takes a start number, or index of the array, the 2nd param is how many values to delete from there,
// the 3rd value is the value to add to the array

// when hovering over

// (method) Array<string>.splice(start: number, deleteCount?: number | undefined): string[] (+1 overload)
// Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

// @param start — The zero-based location in the array from which to start removing elements.

// @param deleteCount — The number of elements to remove.

// @returns — An array containing the elements that were deleted.



// accessing the array, 0(1), piush and pop
// splice, shifting and deleting, is O(n) might not be the fastest when it comes to arrays.

// But their are 2 types of arrays
