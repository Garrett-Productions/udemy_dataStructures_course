// strings.splice(2, 0, 'x') 
// console.log(strings)
// strings.splice(2,1)

// splice takes a start number, or index of the array, the 2nd param is how many values to delete from there,
// the 3rd value is the value to add to the array
// accessing the array, 0(1), piush and pop
// splice, shifting and deleting, is O(n) might not be the fastest when it comes to arrays.

// But their are 2 types of arrays
