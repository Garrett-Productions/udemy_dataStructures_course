Treat any String questions as an array questions, strings are simply array of char's, when getting reverse a string, convert into an array, loop on it, or an operation like split(), and then returning it as a string if asked

Reverse a String
// passed in is "Hi My Name is Andrei"
// output: "ierdnA si EmaN yM iH"
