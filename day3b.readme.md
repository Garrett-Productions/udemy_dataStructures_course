 Overall when it comes to good code it comes to readability and scalability 
 You save time and money for a company, you're a super star

 Big O allows to measure scalable code

 Knowing how much time your code takes and how much meemory it takes is critical

 Big O wont come up every day but it shouild be in the back of your mind always

 We learned about the idea of space and time complexity and how we can use big 0 to find that out

1. What is the worst case scenario with our code so we are prepared for when the time comes?

Time: how long it takes thr algo to run

Space: how much memory it takes up

But scalability isnt the only factor, readability is too.

A good engineer knows how to strike the median between run time, space and readability 
Data needs to be sufficiently big to talk about big(O), its about scaling

if your function is linear time but the input is always 7 times, then the linear time algo, may be better than the constant time algo

TECHNICAL INTERVIEW
- Can you solve the problems that we have? If so, you're valuable to our company and worth the salary

- Will you solve the companies problem? Its about the thought process between time and space complexity, trade offs, data structure utilization

Interviews are about knowing how to think about data structures and algos analytically
