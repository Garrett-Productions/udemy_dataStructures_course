Data Structures

A collection of vaues, with vars and functions. Each data structure is created for specific reasons.

Data structures are ike differnet containers for diff reasons

We put papaers in a file cabinet and not a backpack because a file cabinet is a better container for papers. Like data structures.
We can put thing in DS and remove. 

Programs mdoel real life scenarios, the more time you spend talking about data structures, they hold data for diff reasons.

They exiast for their own specific case.

1. When and how do we use them?
2. DS are just tools, mostly pre built,  when do we use one over the other?

UNDERSTANDING
1. in order for a CPU to run code, it has to staore things like variables(strings, ints, array) them in random access manager or RAM for short. Storage stores our video and music files. Data on storage is persistent, in RAM you lsoe the memory when your computer turns off. Persistent storage is slow, cpu is the worker doing all the calculations we need, it needs aceess to the ram and the storage. Vars are held in RAM, ocne we close an app, when we save it, we save it to our CPU where it's held in storage.
When we open back up, and run our code, all of our code is stored in random access memory, and then we save it again and its stored in in our CPU storage. but during the running our CPU can offload and delegate lots of work to the RAM from the storage. 

The RAM is like our CPU's controller. The RAM is a data structure that holds addresses, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and so on, and those addresses habe an 8 digit number of 0 and 1's attahced to it, known as bits. 
EX) 0 |00000001, the 8 #'s together are called bytes. The CPU itself has very little memory, the RAM handles this, but the CPU stores the most recent stuff, as a copy, in your CPU's cache.
