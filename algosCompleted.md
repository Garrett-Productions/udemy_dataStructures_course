This is an ever growing list 

Categorizing 

Strings
1. Reverse a String - [reversing a given string and returning it as a string]
2. Roman To Int - [convert a romanNum string into its num equivalent]


Arrays
1. Merge Sorted Arrays - [merge already sorted arrays in descending order, into a fully sorted array]
2. First Recurring Character - [Return the first character we see twice]
3. Remove Elements - [remove all occurences of given value in given array, in place, return unique values]
4. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array - [given an array, remove dupes in place so each element appears only once, return number of unique nums]
5. Search Insert Position - [Given an array and a value, return the index of the array if the value is found, if not return the index of where it'd be in sorted order]
6. Two Sum - [given an array of nums, and a value, return the two indices of the array if they add up to value]
7. Insert At - [given an array, index, and value, insert the value in the array at the index]
8. Longest Common Prefix*
9. Valid Parenthesis*

JS Built Ins I've used in these algos, if study more, note them.
1. map.has
2. mas.set
3. map.get
4. indexOf()****
5. substring()****
6. split('')



11/16 Notes
* Reviewing how I categorized these algos, and then Im going to look at them and pick back up on them

Reviewed & Notes
1. First Recurring Character
- I can brute force this, I want to make it more efficient
2. Merge Sorted Arrays
- just keep reviewing this one, this is great, shows the important of base case checks, and using while loops and manually increasing an interator based on conditionals
